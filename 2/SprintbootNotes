SPRINGBOOT TIPS:
Spring dev tools dependency works like webpack. Spring Tool Suite works automatically. IntelliJ IDea needs 2 additional steps for auto build and run.

Lombok
@Builder   -> implements builder pattern

JUNIT and Mockito

Mock Method annotations :
@BeforeEach -> calls every time before a test case is run.
@BeforeAll -> calls once before executing all test cases.

@AfterEach
@AfterAll

@MockBean
DepartementRepository departmentRepository;

@BeforeEach
void setup(){
	//Department is an entity and it has lombok's @Builder annotation which is like Example where an object will be built only based on values we pass
	Department dep = Department.builder().departmentName("IT").departmentCode("IT-06").departmentId(1).build();
	
	//means whenever in ur unit test case "findbyDepartmentNameIgnoreCase" method is called, department object will be returned.
	Mockito.when(departmentRepository.findByDepartmentNameIgnoreCase("IT")).thenReturn(department);
}

@Test
@DisplayName("Get data based on department Name")   //this is used to get bettr name than fn name in reports
@Disabled // this is used to disable annotation
public void whenValidDeptName_thenDeptShouldBeFound(){
	//we are testing the service layer only
	Department dept = departmentRepository.fetchDepartmentByName("IT");
	
	//service layer calls repo layer which is mocked above.
	
	assertEquals("IT",dept.getDepartmentName());
	
}

//Testing JPA Repository layer

@DataJpaTest  // this annotation will store data in db only for this testing and remove once testin done.
class DepartmentRepositoryTest{

	@Autowired
	private DepartmentRepository deptRepo;
	
	//also needed entity manager for testing repo layer.
	@Autowired
	private TestEntityManager entityManager;
	
	@BeforeEach
	void setup(){
		Department dept = Department.builder().departmentName("Mech").deptartmentId(1).build();

	}
	
	@Test
	public void whenFindById(){
		Department dept = deptRepo.findById(1).get();
		assertEquals("Mech", dept.getDepartmentName());
	}

}

JUNIT for Controller:

@WebMvcTest(DepartmentController.class)
class DepartmentControllerTest {
	
	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;
	
	//since testing controller, we need to mock the service
	@MockBean
	private DeptService deptService;
	
	@Autowired
	Department dept;
	
	@BeforeEach
	void setup() {
		dept = Department.builder().///.build();			//-> this is entire dept as output.
	}
	
	@Test  
	void saveDepartment(){  //this is saveDept of service layer.. it takes entire dept as input and entire dept as output.
		Department inputdept = Department.builder().///.build();			//-> this is entire dept as input. input wont have deptId.
		
		Mockito.when(deptService.saveDepartment(inputdept)).thenReturn(dept);
		
		mockMvc.perform(MockMvcBuilders.post("/departments").contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
		.content("paste the whole postman json sturcture here")).andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.status.isOk());

4.10.00   how to have different profiles dev, qa, prod under same application.yml itself.
in .yml --- is used to separate documents under same .yml file.

customer actuator endpoints - 4:24:00

JPA Table constraints : 4:57:00

@Modifying -> is used to enhance @Query annotation on JPA repo methods where u can write insert, update, delete, create operation

6.9.00 -> unidirectional and bidirectional oneToOne Mapping.

JPA recommends to use ManyToOne than OneToMany because list is used in the latter.

6:28:00 -> paging and sorting repository

6:40:00 -> ManyToMany -> means mapping table is needed


You autowire the interface so you can wire in a different implementation--that's one of the points of coding to the interface, 
not the class.
As long as there is only a single implementation of the interface 
and that implementation is annotated with @Component with Spring's component scan enabled, 
Spring framework can find out the (interface, implementation) pair.
 If component scan is not enabled, then you have to define the bean explicitly in your application-config.xml 
 (or equivalent spring configuration file).

Do I need @Qualifier or @Resource?

Once you have more than one implementation, then you need to qualify each of them and during auto-wiring, 
you would need to use the @Qualifier annotation to inject the right implementation, 
along with @Autowired annotation. If you are using @Resource (J2EE semantics),
 then you should specify the bean name using the name attribute of this annotation.

Why do we autowire the interface and not the implemented class?

Firstly, it is always a good practice to code to interfaces in general. 
Secondly, in case of spring, you can inject any implementation at runtime.
A typical use case is to inject mock implementation during testing stage.

@Component    
class MyRunner
{
     @Autowire
     @Qualifier("b") 
     IA worker;

     ....
     worker.someFunction();
}

@Qualifiers -> is used when you have 2 implementation classes for an interface and when u autowired an interface, 
you can specify which implementation you need.

@Primary Annotation
If we know that we favor one implementation over another by default, 
we can forego the @Qualifier annotation and add the @Primary annotation directly to a class.


?@Component Preferable for component scanning and automatic wiring.

When should you use @Bean?

Sometimes automatic configuration is not an option. 
When? Let's imagine that you want to wire components from 3rd-party libraries
 (you don't have the source code so you can't annotate its classes with @Component), 
so automatic configuration is not possible.
The @Bean annotation returns an object that spring should register as bean in application context. 
The body of the method bears the logic responsible for creating the instance.

ENTITY MANAGER:
@Autowired 
EntityManager em;

em.getTransaction.begin();

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.append("SELECT FROM ").append("STUDENT ").append("where STUDENT_ID=:studentId");

Query query = em.createQuery(sb.toString());
query.setParameter("studentId",studentId);
int rows = query.executeUpdate();
em.getTransaction.commit();

em.getTrasaction.begin();
sb.append("select count(*) from student where student_id=:studentId")
Query query = em.createNativeQuery(sb.toString());
query.setParameter("studentId", studentId);
int count = ((Number)query.getSingleResult()).intValue();

ENTITY CLASS:
An entity class must fulfill the following requirements:

The class must have a no-argument constructor.
The class can't be final.
The class must be annotated with @Entity annotation.
The class must implement a Serializable interface if value passes an empty instance as a detached object.

restTemplate.postForObject
return ResponseEntity.created(uriComponents.toUri()).body(getMappingJacksonValue(t,fields));

@EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude={DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
If the class is not on the classpath, then to exclude the auto-configuration, you have to mention the following code:

@EnableAutoConfiguration(excludeName={Sample.class})

First, Spring attempts to create the Foo object. 
During this process, Spring recognizes that a Bar object is required. 
In order to construct the Bar object, a Foo object is needed. 
Since the Foo object is currently under construction—the original reason a Bar object was being created
—Spring recognizes that a circular reference may have occurred.

One of the simplest solutions to this problem is to use the @Lazy annotation on one of the classes and at the point of injection. 
This instructs Spring to defer the initialization of the annotated bean and the annotated @Autowired location. 
This allows one of the beans to be successfully initialized, thus breaking the circular dependency chain. 

The logic contained in the ApplicationContext is often referred to as the Spring Container. 
In general, a Spring application can have more than one ApplicationContext, 
and each ApplicationContext can have separate configurations.
 For example, one ApplicationContext may be configured to use the CombustionEngine, 
 as its Engine implementation while another container
  may be configured to use the ElectricEngine as its implementation. 
  
The “HttpMessageConverter” is a good example of the “Strategy design pattern” with different implementations 
like “MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter” to read and write JSON using Jackson’s ObjectMapper, 
and “MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter” to read and write XML using Jackson XML extension’s XmlMapper,
 “StringHttpMessageConverter” to read and write Strings from the HTTP request and response, 
 “FormHttpMessageConverter” to read and write form data from the HTTP request and response, and so on. 
 You can also create your own custom implementation of the “HttpMessageConverter”.
 
 
@Bean
public SimpleMappingExceptionResolver exceptionResolver() {
    SimpleMappingExceptionResolver exceptionResolver = new SimpleMappingExceptionResolver();
 
    Properties exceptionMappings = new Properties();
 
    exceptionMappings.put("java.lang.Exception", "error/error");
    exceptionMappings.put("java.lang.RuntimeException", "error/error");
 
    exceptionResolver.setExceptionMappings(exceptionMappings);
 
    Properties statusCodes = new Properties();
 
    statusCodes.put("error/404", "404");
    statusCodes.put("error/error", "500");
 
    exceptionResolver.setStatusCodes(statusCodes);
 
    return exceptionResolver;
} 

@ExceptionHandler({IOException.class, java.sql.SQLException.class})
public ModelAndView handleIOException(Exception ex) {
    ModelAndView model = new ModelAndView("IOError");
    model.addObject("exception", ex.getMessage());
    return model;
} 

@Configuration
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "mail")
public class ConfigProperties {
    
    private String hostName;
    private int port;
    private String from;

    // standard getters and setters
}
Note: If we don't use @Configuration in the POJO, 
then we need to add @EnableConfigurationProperties(ConfigProperties.class) 
in the main Spring application class to bind the properties into the POJO:

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigurationProperties(ConfigProperties.class)
public class EnableConfigurationDemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EnableConfigurationDemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}

Handler interceptors are used when you want to apply specific behaviour to certain requests. 
Handler Interceptors should implement the interface “HandlerInterceptor” to provide specific behaviours 
via “preHandle(..)”, “postHandle(..)”, and “afterCompletion(..)” methods
//....
public class LoggingInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor  {
    
    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler)
        throws Exception {
        //....
    }
    
    @Override
    public void postHandle(    HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,
            Object handler, ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception {
        //...
    }
    
    @Override
    public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,
            Object handler, Exception ex) throws Exception {
        //...        
    }
} 
you can also extends HandlerInterceptorAdapter.
finally the Java Configuration class will have an entry as
@Override
public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
    registry.addInterceptor(new LoggingInterceptor());
    registry.addInterceptor(new TransactionInterceptor()).addPathPatterns("/account");
}

@Controller Map of the model object to view or template and make it human readable 
but @RestController simply returns the object and object data is directly written in HTTP response as JSON or XML.


@Component auto detects and configures the beans using classpath scanning whereas @Bean explicitly declares a single bean, rather than letting Spring do it automatically.
@Component does not decouple the declaration of the bean from the class definition where as @Bean decouples the declaration of the bean from the class definition.
@Component is a class level annotation whereas @Bean is a method level annotation and name of the method serves as the bean name.
@Component need not to be used with the @Configuration annotation where as @Bean annotation has to be used within the class which is annotated with @Configuration.
We cannot create a bean of a class using @Component, if the class is outside spring container whereas we can create a bean of a class using @Bean even if the class is present outside the spring container.
@Component has different specializations like @Controller, @Repository and @Service whereas @Bean has no specializations.

A Classpath scanning basically means, detecting the classes that need to be managed by the Spring under a specified package. 

@Component (and @Service and @Repository) are used to auto-detect and auto-configure beans using classpath scanning. 
There's an implicit one-to-one mapping between the annotated class and the bean (i.e. one bean per class). 
Control of wiring is quite limited with this approach, since it's purely declarative.

@Bean is used to explicitly declare a single bean, rather than letting Spring do it automatically as above. 
It decouples the declaration of the bean from the class definition, 
and lets you create and configure beans exactly how you choose.

Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects 
or portions of a program to a container or framework.
IoC Container is a framework that is used for implementing automatic dependency injection. 
It manages object creation and its lifetime. It, it also injects dependencies into the class.

Dependency Injection is passing dependency to other objects or framework( dependency injector).
decoupling the creation of object (in other word, separate usage from the creation of object)
ability to replace dependencies (eg: Wheel, Battery) without changing the class that uses it(Car)
promotes "Code to interface not to implementation" principle.

Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies. 
This is achieved by decoupling the usage of an object from its creation. 

Dependency injection allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class, 
and it provides those objects to a class in different ways. 
The user can move the creation and binding of the dependent objects outside of the class that depends on them, using dependency injection.
High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.


In the Spring framework, the interface ApplicationContext represents the IoC container. 
The Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring and assembling objects known as beans, 
as well as managing their life cycles.

@EnableAutoConfiguration in spring boot tells how you want to configure spring, 
based on the jars that you have added in your classpath. 
For example, if you add spring-boot-starter-web dependency in your classpath, 
it automatically configures Tomcat and Spring MVC.
AutoConfiguration is a process by which Spring Boot automatically configures all the infrastructural beans.

@JsonPropertyOrder
We can use the @JsonPropertyOrder annotation to specify the order of properties on serialization.

Jackson
Jackson is a suite of data-processing tools for Java. 
It allows to read and write data in JSON, Avro, BSON, CBOR, CSV, Smile, (Java) Properties, Protobuf, XML or YAML format.

Jackson is auto-configured. It comes with the spring-boot-starter-json. 
When Jackson is on the classpath an ObjectMapper bean is automatically configured. 
The spring-boot-starter-json is pulled with the spring-boot-starter-web.

In Spring objects are automatically converted to JSON with the Jackson library. 

The. @JsonIgnore. annotation marks a field in a POJO to be ignored by Jackson during serialization and deserialization. 

Injecting a property with the @Value annotation is straightforward:

@Value( "${jdbc.url}" )
private String jdbcUrl;

The @PropertySource annotation is repeatable according to Java 8 conventions. Therefore, if we're using Java 8 or higher, we can use this annotation to define multiple property locations:

@PropertySource("classpath:foo.properties")
@PropertySource("classpath:bar.properties")
public class PropertiesWithJavaConfig {
    //...
}
Of course, we can also use the @PropertySources annotation and specify an array of @PropertySource. This works in any supported Java version, not just in Java 8 or higher:

@PropertySources({
    @PropertySource("classpath:foo.properties"),
    @PropertySource("classpath:bar.properties")
})
public class PropertiesWithJavaConfig {
    //...
}

A test method annotated with @Ignore will not be executed. 
If a test class is annotated with @Ignore, then none of its test methods will be executed. 


The Spring Boot Actuator provides the @Endpoint annotation to specify the endpoint.

By default, this endpoint is allowed for both HTTP and JMX.

The @Endpoint-annotated class will have  @ReadOperation,  @WriteOperation, and  @DeleteOperation. 
These annotated methods will provide a new endpoint for all of these endpoints.

@Selector is an annotation to mark the method argument as part of the request URI.
